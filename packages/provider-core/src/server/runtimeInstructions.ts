/** Session-invariant; harnesses with a native system-prompt append can carry it once per session. */
export const PULL_REQUEST_LINKING_INSTRUCTIONS = `<pull_request_linking>
Link each PR you create, take over, or push to: link_pull_request, or link_pull_requests for several, full URL, every stack layer, as your next call. If linking fails, say so. Skip PRs you only read or review, and PRs named only as background. T3 watches linked or created PRs unless stopped; parents watch child PRs. Act until CI is green, the branch merges cleanly and reviews are addressed. Use watch_pull_request to resume or monitor. Finish any needed branch update and push first, then watch and end your turn. Otherwise act now or hand back. Delegated children never watch, even if the brief says babysit. After PR work, a child's last line is: PR <full URL>, head <SHA>, checks and reviews <state>. Links and watches persist across pushes. For PR waits, no sleep, loops, gh --watch, Monitor or ScheduleWakeup. Before handback, call unwatch_pull_request on any PR you watch.
